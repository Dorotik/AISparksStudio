			<Char_Desc_2000>AI Sparks Studio is a user interface that allows you to efficiently utilize your own API access to state-of-the-art AI models. Engage in expert discussions with AI models like OpenAI’s GPT-4 or GPT-4o, have your speech converted to text using the capable Whisper model, and transform discussions into lifelike speech audio with the ElevenLabs service. With AI Sparks Studio, you have full control over your AI interactions. Every time you hit the Generate button, the AI reads the entire discussion and generates an appropriate response. This process is fully transparent - your discussion and the generated response remain unchanged. You’re in charge of managing the model’s context memory limitation, with clear insight into its usage, limit, and the estimated cost of generation. Customize how your AI processes input, understand the details of AI processing, experiment freely with AI using discussion branching, and secure your data with local storage. All discussion files are stored exclusively on your machine. AI Sparks Studio communicates directly and exclusively with AI services for which API keys are provided, upon request. It sends a request to the pre-authorized AI service, receives a response, and stores it locally on your machine. The configured API keys are also stored exclusively on your machine, within the application’s configuration JSON file, easily located via the Settings dialog.</Char_Desc_2000>
