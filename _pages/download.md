Thank you for your interest in AI Sparks Studio! Know that it's **completely free, without any ads or spyware.**

As a solo-developer passion project, the application lacks extensive testing and features that perhaps many people would find essential. **Any feedback is welcome** at <span id="email"></span>

Supported operating systems:
:   Windows 10 (64-bit)
:   Windows 11

As a free non-monetized passion project, AI Sparks Studio **lacks an expensive signature from a certification authority**. This automatically makes it untrustworty by [Microsoft SmartScreen filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SmartScreen) and various antivirus software. If you decide to trust this application but Windows doesn't allow you to install it, click *More info* and *Run anyway*, as shown in the example below:

};
