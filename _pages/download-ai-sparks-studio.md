AI Sparks Studio is a free, non-monetized passion project and, as such, **does not carry an expensive signature from a certification authority**. This lack of certification may trigger warnings from the [Microsoft SmartScreen filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SmartScreen) and various antivirus software. 

If you trust this application and wish to proceed with the installation but Windows blocks the process, click *More info* and then *Run anyway*, as shown in the example below:
